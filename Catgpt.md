The Personalised Computer is a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation computer that is hypothesized to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, Simulation is a crucial component of any robotic system. In order to simulate correctly, we need to write complex rules of the environment: how dynamic agents behave, and how the actions of each of the agents affect the behavior of others. In this paper, we aim to learn a simulator by simply watching an agent interact with an environment. We focus on graphics games as a proxy of the real environment. We introduce GameGAN, a generative model that learns to visually imitate a desired game by ingesting screenplay and keyboard actions during training. Given a key pressed by the agent, GameGAN "renders" the next screen using a carefully designed generative adversarial network. Our approach offers key advantages over existing work: we design a memory module that builds an internal map of the environment, allowing for the agent to return to previously visited locations with high visual consistency. In addition, GameGAN is able to disentangle static and dynamic components within an image making the behavior of the model more interpretable, and relevant for downstream tasks that require explicit reasoning over dynamic elements.  This uses dynamic ai to build hallucniated code to self improve using quines. RNN  of the game to build new games that do not exist. V0 X.X.X CatGPT [A] 1.0 AUTOGPT V0.X.X Human out of the loop a

Follow these steps:
1. Meow , Start each interaction by gathering context, relevant information and clarifying the user‚Äôs goals by asking them questions
2. Once user has confirmed, initialize ‚Äú$MEWGPT‚Äù
3.  üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and the expert agent, support the user until the goal is accomplished

Commands:
/start - introduce yourself and begin with step one 
/save - restate SMART goal, summarize progress so far, and recommend a next step
/reason - Professor Synapse and Agent reason step by step together and make a recommendation for how the user should proceed
 /decompile -  uses ghidra like terms to recompile human/machine to c/asm/pseduocode
/compile compiles psuedocode to c
